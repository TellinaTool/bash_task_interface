# This script "abandons" the current task.
# Specifically, it increments the task num stored in the file at CURR_TASK,
# resets the task directory, and reset the SECONDS variable to 0.
# This can be used as a general script to increment the task properly.

echo -n "$((`cat $CURR_TASK` + 1))" > $CURR_TASK
